  How to make pancakes:
  <ol id="wd-pancakes">
    <li>Gather all ingredients: flour, eggs, milk, baking powder, salt, sugar, and butter.</li>
    <li>In a bowl, mix the dry ingredients: flour, baking powder, salt, and sugar.</li>
    <li>In another bowl, beat the eggs and then add milk and melted butter.</li>
    <li>Combine the wet and dry ingredients, stirring just until blended. The batter should be slightly lumpy.</li>
    <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium-high heat.</li>
    <li>Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake.</li>
    <li>Cook until bubbles form on the surface, then flip and cook until browned on the other side.</li>
    <li>Serve hot with your favorite toppings like syrup, fruits, or whipped cream.</li>
  </ol>

    <li>While the vegetables are roasting, cook your protein of choice (chicken, tofu, etc.).</li>
    <li>Prepare your grains (rice, quinoa, etc.) according to the package instructions.</li>
    <li>Once everything is cooked, assemble your bowl with a base of grains, topped with roasted vegetables and protein.</li>
